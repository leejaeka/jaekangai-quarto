    "text": "0. Introduction\nMy machine learning career began from a book, ‚ÄúHands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Rich dad and Poor dad\nI was looking for a book to study finance and money. I‚Äôve searched ‚Äòintroduction to finance book‚Äô and some asian dude stared at me from list of recommended books on Google. I thought it was funny so I‚Äôve read it.\n\nAsset vs liability : Key concept of the book. Make asset your priority, pay liability last.\nBook will constantly humiliate those who pay mortgages. Author strongly believes buying a house is a liability and not an asset and this had me confused because real estate is a great investment in 2020s. This may be due to cultural and generation difference.\nRich people love to talk about money because it often leads to opportunity.\n\nI am an experienced gamer so I already understood the value of taking risks (ex.TFT). What the book has taught me is to look for business ideas from watching random stuff. For example, I was observing a real estate agent present an apartment unit that hasn‚Äôt been built yet. But they were able to show 360 degree view from a floor of their choosing as if a photo taken from the future. A drone business!\n\n\n2. Atomic Habits\n‚ÄúWhat could this book be possibly talking about for 20 chapters? ‚ÄòJust do it‚Äô 20times?‚Äù was my initial thought. Probably the best practical book I‚Äôve read. Here are examples of how I‚Äôve applied to my life, without the whys.\n\nI am a reader, so I read at least 30 minute before going to sleep.\nI hid distracting apps such as Youtube, Instagram, TradingView, etc from bookmarks (desktop) and main screen (phone). Now they require at least one or more clicks to access, creating friction.\nWhen I want to have a cold drink, my brain think I must exercise so I can reward myself a drink. Gaslighting my brain.\nI spend my time regularly on Kaggle, an online data science community. And I just do things on Kaggle, writing code and reading notebooks.\nI play calm noise on my earbud to cue a focus period. Similarly, I wear ear plugs as a cue just before sleep.\nI am a climber, so I go bouldering everyday.\nI prepare something before sleep for the time I wake up. For example, I go for a run every other day, so for even days, I prepare exercise clothes, earbuds, keys and phone in one place making it easy to access after waking up like a combo.\nI measure and track every minute I spend reading, studying, working and journaling on app called forest. It creates satisfaction and after all, I am a data scientist.\n\nGreat easy book, definetly recommend to everyone!.\n\n\n3. 5AM club\nI don‚Äôt recommend this book. Try a summarisation tool instead. Personally, I felt that I was searching a trash bin for promised treasures. Anyhoo, here are the ‚Äòtreasures‚Äô\n\nTransient hypofrontality: prefrontal cortex, that part of your brain responsible for rational thinking‚Äîas well as constant worrying‚Äîactually shuts off for a short time at 5am.\nEach day we get limited brain bandwidth - so distractions eats away our bandwidth in focusing. For this reason, some wear same thing everyday.\nBrain triggers warning when embracing changes (even positive changes). Be aware of this self-sabotaging brain. For example, spending time scrolling on Reels is your brain letting you be comfortable. When you try to change this, your brain may refuse, making it hard to put down your phone.\n20/20/20 rule - Once you wake up, 20 minutes of exercise, 20 journaling and 20 reading. I do this everyday because it really clears my mind before starting your day. Personally, I believe 20min exercise is most important. (Lot of Brain details I liked that I won‚Äôt cover here)\nDo not technology before and after sleep. I discovered ‚Äòdo not distrub‚Äô schedule option on my phone that helps me with this. (Lot of Brain and sleep details I liked that I won‚Äôt cover here)\n\nFrom this book, I‚Äôve realized the importance of habit stacking sleep. Effectively starting a day sounds attractive and also scientifically healthier so I am practicing early sleep, early morning and early 20/20/20 exercises. Do I wake up at 5am? No, I wake up at 7 or 8.\n\n\n4. How to talk to anyone\nCommunication is important. My mbti is INTJ so I am always trying to optimize my messages. Often I would use pictures, numbers or memes to express my idea. So not everything from this book I found applicable.\n\nDon‚Äôt smile when you greet. Instead, Pause. Soak in their persona. Then smile\nLimit the fidget, twitch, wiggle, scratch and squirm.\nAnalyse your partner in detail when they speak. Notice things and spend time thinking on it.\nThink about how you can make yourself more approchable. Noticeable shades and not crossing your arm.\nParroting. Parroting?\nSubstitue a commonly used word and practice using it.\nTell a friend instead of your target when complimenting. Otherwise make compliment appear accidental.\nRecord all your business conversations and listen to them again\nEmpty their thoughs before pitching your important ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Quite\nThis book caught my attention because I am an introvert. Maybe I can leverage something out of being introvert.\n\nIn western culture, extrovert is more valued. For example in Harvard business school, if you don‚Äôt speak up, you are out.\nIn Eastern culture, introvert is more valued. For example if you speak like an extrovert, you are viewed as thoughtless person.\nIntrovert and extrovert is real, but it is not well defined. For example, what‚Äôs the threshold?\nWe are born introvert or extrovert. When your senses are more sensitive, you are introvert. Vice versa.\nAmygdala, part of the brain that controls how to process data, sensitivity determines whether to react to a popping balloon or not. If you don‚Äôt react, you are extrovert.\nCortical thickness is different between introverts and extroverts\nThe reason why less sensitive equals extrovert is because they require more stimulation to feel satisfied. For example, louder music is required to achieve same level of ‚Äòjust right‚Äô amount of volume for the extroverts, compared to introverts who require less loudness.\nLater in the book it talks about how to raise a child and how to choose the right environment for them. Simlarly, you could also choose right environment for your work team such as open office versus closed office.\n\nOverall, the book was informative and interesting. It made me think that being an introvert is better than extrovert, although that is not the point of the book.\n\n\n6. Make your bed\nThis book was fun to read because of author‚Äôs army stories. Do you know what a sugar cookie is? It is when you dive into sea water, roll around in the sand.\nThe book however was too shallow. Don‚Äôt give up, work with team, life isn‚Äôt fair, don‚Äôt fear risks, etc. No neuroscience behind each points.\n\n\n7. Why we want you to be rich\nI didn‚Äôt know Donald Trump was an author.\n\nIndia is the largest English-speaking nation in the world, in the last 10000 years, India has never invaded any country.\nThis book is for people who wants to take risks and win. Those who refuse to live below their means. (There is a book called ‚Äòmillionaire next door‚Äô that teach the opposite, living below the means to get rich. Personally that book was too boring)\nGovernment want a balance of those who create jobs and not everyone looking for a job. Hence those who creates jobs are rewarded with tax cuts.\nGovernment want those who bring resources to the country such as gold, oil and silver. Tax cut.\nLearn how to leverage, search real life examples of how others do this.\nControl your assets. Noting that buying stocks has no control (it is gambling after all)\nInvest time in to investing, build a habit.\n\nThis book is definetly not for everyone. For example, it strongly recommend adding golf to your hobby but I disagree. I don‚Äôt like golfing.\n\n\n8. 12 Rules to live by\nThis book is so long.\n\nStand tall and confident, be the winning lobster. More because if you stay depressed and not confident, you will fall deeper into this positive feedback loop trap.\nWhy do more people take care of their pets more than themselves? Author‚Äôs argument comes from the bible that we are still paying the price of eating the apple at Eden. Just like how Adam and Eve immediately was ashamed to show themselves to god with new consciousness, we lower ourselves to the point where we even suicide. But we have to remember we are not something we own but there is small divine with each one of us and we belong to god. Anyways the point is treat yourself well just as you treat others(even dogs) well.\nMake friends with people who want the best for you. More importantly, let bad influences drift away.\nCompare yourself to you over time because it is foolish to compare yourself to everyone in the world in specific domains.\nWe blind ourselves from things we unconsciously define unimportant. For example, our vision takes a lot of energy so we only get ‚Äòhigh resolution‚Äô on objects we think are important. Rest will appear blurry and even invisible. This applies to what we think of important to our lives not only in vision. For example, instead of thinking I want to make more money, it would be important to think maybe you can‚Äôt stop wanting more money and it‚Äôs a problem.\nWhen we are raising children, discipline is important. The author is very annoyed at those parents who passes this duty to the real world which often result in a mess. I wonder what stuff I can start now to ensure my children are raised above average. Maybe I‚Äôll ask school teacher at my church.\nSo it wasn‚Äôt only me that think that we are nothing and nothing matters in the very long term therefore chasing pleasure everyday is a valid solution. Of course I do this with respect to others, but some ignore that rule and kill people by ‚Äòfreeing‚Äô them.\nBible talks a lot about sacrifice. Sacrifice something today for better tomorrow. Jesus sacrificed everything for human, notice that he sacrificed for others and not himself.\nListen to others and assume you have something to learn from them.\nDon‚Äôt lie\nSo what should you do? Don‚Äôt lie to yourself and look for truths as they may be in front of you, but your brain instinctively justifies it with abstract reasons.\nHow to listen to someone - summarize their speech before speaking yours. Noting that summarizing is hard so practice this starting now.\nAuthor views technology as a note on a unmeasurable sheet. Our computers are being played now but it will be discarded in many years.\nWorld is too complex. Therefore we ignore everything. Except what we think are important.\nLearn to admit that there is a problem.\nA playground made too safe will be unpopular. If made too dangerous, kids will die.\n\n\n\n9. How to talk to strangers\n\nSometimes knowing less about someone is actually knowing more. In America, judge releases false positive criminals all the time because they unknowingly take other factors in to consideration besides what is on the paper. For this reason, a simple machine learning model can outperform judge by 20 something percent regarding releasing criminals that commits some sort of crime again.\nPeople who have met with Hitler were all convinced that this man didn‚Äôt want war, he wasn‚Äôt crazy and rather practical. Contrast to Churchill whom never met Hitler yet he would never trust Hitler and he was correct.\nAnother example is a cuban spy who was up high in DIA ranks. In all three examples, it is natural for human to default to classifying others as good unless there is a significant red flag. And such habit makes it harder to identify red flags.\n\n\n\n10. The power of habits\n\nBrain & Stored Habits\n\n\nEven with memory loss, basal ganglia allows habit retention\nExample: Patient with brain surgery could solve puzzles instinctively despite no memory\n\n\nBreaking Bad Habits\n\n\nKeep the cue and reward, change the routine\nExample: Replace drug use with snacking when bored\n\n\nRecovery & Group Belief\n\n\nAlcoholics often credit recovery to religious belief\nKey factor: Group support creates belief in possibility of change\n\n\nWorkplace Safety as Core Habit\n\n\nAluminum factory safer than McDonald‚Äôs\nCEO‚Äôs 24-hour accident reporting policy created efficient communication system\nResult: Company value increased 5x through safety-first culture\n\n\nEducational Impact on Health\n\n\nSolution to high infant mortality: Better teacher biology education\nImproved nutrition knowledge led to 60% drop in baby deaths\n\n\nWillpower Mechanics\n\n\nActs like a muscle - can be depleted\nStudy: Cookie resisters showed less persistence in puzzle solving\n\n\nGroup Dynamics & Habits\n\n\nPoor communication habits between doctors and nurses increase hospital errors\nExample: Nurses being silenced leads to mistakes\n\n\nRetail & Consumer Habits\n\n\nTarget tracks pregnancy data for marketing\nStores place healthy items at entrance to encourage balanced shopping\n\n\nMarketing to New Parents\n\n\nPregnancy triggers new shopping habits\nSolution: Hide targeted ads among regular products to avoid customer discomfort\nSimilar to radio stations mixing new songs between familiar ones\n\n\nSocial Pressure & Habits\n\n\nCommunity pressure enforces collective action\nExample: Bus boycott success through social accountability\n\n\nHabit Power Over Consciousness\n\n\nTwo cases showing habit dominance:\n\nResponsible gambler losing control\nSleepwalking man committed crime unconsciously\n\n\n\n\n11. Guns germs and steel\nI wanted to be a archaeologist at one point\n\nHumanities have expanded all across globe. Question is did we start from one point on Earth (Adam and Eve) or from multiple points?\nA lot of suggestion say that big mammals in America and Australia became extinct just about the similar time humans have reached those continents. Some say no, it was the weather but these mammals experienced many ice ages and survived. So there is no evidence of large mammals domesticated\nAmerica has no evidence of humanity before cloverites, whom crossed from russia to alaska around 11000bc\n200 Spanish captured the Inca emperor. First, Spanish people went to heart of Inca (I‚Äôm assuming they were invited). To Incas they seem harmless and I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt just kill them off here. Later, emperor was invited to Spanish camp where Spanish were planning an ambush. I don‚Äôt know if it was their main plan, but when emperor was introduced to bible, he threw away, initializing the ambush. What if Inca showed more respect to bible?\nAnyways, the guns were definitely effective but it was not what slaughtered Inca army of thousands. One hundred calvaries wearing steel armor was juggernaut compared to clubs used by Inca. This is hard to imagine but makes sense.\nInca emperor had no information so he figured he could capture 200 spanish (not even thiinking they are army) spanish men. He didn‚Äôt know they were here to conquer his empire.\nFrom hunter gatherer to farmers, some aquired this skill from neighbor tribes, either by invading them or being invaded by them. Different parts of the world developed farming at staggeringly differnt times.\nNote that farming wasn‚Äôt that attractive in the early stages. Some areas simply benefited more in hunting gathering. Some neighbors saw farming and didn‚Äôt absorb any of its tech for thousands of years.\ndid a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human popula tion density? Probably both in a positive feedback loop that accelerate fast\nWhen building farms, berries like strawberries were likely defeated by birds.\nA lot of crops were genetically chosen by humans so wild plants may be very different from tamed plants\nHunter gatherers are basically walking natural resource encyclopedia. Which suggests that Fertile Crescent people were very well aware of their natural habitat and potential crops. I would have thought they would trial and error in their lifetime, but this knowledge is collected and passed on for ten thousand years.\nFactors that determine domesticable animals : the animal‚Äôs diet, growth rate, mating habits, disposition, tendency to panic, and several distinct features of social organization.\nI couldn‚Äôt stand the mundane plant spread chapter so i skipped it.\nFever is our body trying to kill microbes\nNote that epidemic can only survive with large enough population. Otherwise, they just die out with the hosts.\nIsn‚Äôt it strange that natives got almost wiped out by European disease but not the other way around? Europeans developed immunity to similar diseases because they have spent centuries with domestic animals, and most diseases transfer from domestic animals. American had fewer domestic animals too. Also, European are highly density society such that they already went through a lot of epidemics, and those who survived passed their stronger genetics against diseases.\nQWERTY keyboard was designed to make typing slower because typing adjacent key in quick succession would jam in the earliest models.\nNo protection for inventors make slower tech advances\nSo some tribes find answers from past and doesn‚Äôt like tech, some tribes do. Author is not sure what determines this behavior. Personally, I think it‚Äôs probably religion issue.\nSome technologies such as guns were introduced in Japan, but lost because of samurai government structure.\nWhen we see things like steam engine invention, we see technology go from 0 to 100, but people at those time will only see 0 to 1 and even less because they wouldn‚Äôt directly see the uses and its spread vertically nor horizontally. That is why technology advances are rare (my thoughts reading the book, not a point from the book)\nHow did states arise? How did sacrificing yourself to the king or country become a norm?\nReading this book makes me wonder : we have to guess a lot of hows and whys in such questions because at those times, who would of thought it was important that they keep record of how everything came to be for people thousands of years later. Which leads to how do we answer questions two thousands years from now asking about us? Is internet and digital records going to automatically answer every questions without needing special efforts from us? I do write journal everyday maybe that could help.\n\n\n\n12. Good to Great\nThe book is a good book, not a great book.\n\nEvery good to great company had level 5 leadership meaning they had humble, from inside CEOs\nThis book seem to be a statistic report book, trying to tell a story through data\nWhen things go bad, blame themselves\nI wonder what leaders who didn‚Äôt make the top eleven CEO in this book are like. Reader in the dark for 12th, 13th, ‚Ä¶, 100th, 1000th, etc. So feel a bit skeptical reading the book as a data scientist.\nThey said to hire the right people and get wrong people off the bus. How to determine right people? They value their work, ethics, behaviour over experience or skills. How to determine wrong people? Would you hire them again, if they were to resign how would you feel\nStockdale paradox: Retain absolute faith that you can and will prevail, at the same time face current reality\nBeing too charismatic kills ideas from employees\nFace data driven reality.\nGood to great companies have a hedgehog skill. That is they have a skill that is intersection of their ‚Äòcan we be best in the world at is‚Äô, ‚Äòdoes it have economic value‚Äô, ‚Äòare we passionate about this‚Äô. And they one trick pony\nBook mentions that few great company CEO says luck was their most powerful asset. I believe them.\n\n\n\n13. Zero to One\n\nA startup guidebook. I think the author is co founder of Paypal and was there when it merged with X.com Elon Musk\nLook for monopoly. Competition will kill your business, because it benefits consumers not your business.\nWe are not a lottery ticket. We need to have a concrete plan with optimistic minds to change the world.\nFor example, US is gradually turning total indefinite optimist which means they think future is going to be great but doesn‚Äôt take action towards big goals. For example, look at how we went to the moon 1970s and we had projects like Manhattan projects, golden gate bridge, empire state building built in few years. Now government focuses more on insurances.\nStartup is a great place to have a big goal, for example, Apple was not lucky.\nBiotech and education has been stalled for many years now, a big contrast to vertical upgrades of computer tech\nStartup tips, start with small or even no customers. Start with small monopoly, for example Paypal monopolizing ebay.com trades\nThere‚Äôs an idea that every secret in the worlds is already discovered and only really easy or impossible are left to learn. This is highly unlikely. For example, trigonometry we learn in school is easy, problems even Einstein couldn‚Äôt solve is impossible, etc. Secret would be something like proving a math theorem where you have to believe that it is possible.\n80-20 rule says 20 percent of force will dominate the 80, for example in startup worlds, only a few percentage makes big gains to Venture capitalists. So it is generally a best strategy to reduce diversity as much as possible. For example, someone invested 250k to Instagram when they had few billion diversified in many startups. They still made 15million dollar but they clearly took it too safe, losing more on other startup investments.\n\nI feel that the author has a strong belief in the direction he is concluding, which makes me careful in believing everything he says. Especially when he said physicians are full of themselves and when he interviewed a physician and when they made a confident mistake, author said it was an easy rejection. Which just seem unfair to not give someone a chance for one mistake."

Large language model solutions\n\n2.3.1. llama3.1 finetune on train data\nAt the time of writing, Meta has recently released a new open-source model, Llama 3.1, which presents an exciting opportunity for fine-tuning. However, a key challenge arises from the model‚Äôs default behavior, as it is designed to generate the most probable word sequence from its dictionary. In contrast, our competition requires a regression output that predicts user distribution in floating-point values. To address this, we modify the output layer of Llama 3.1 by replacing it with a trio of neurons, enabling classification into one of three categories.\nRemember, this is not a classification competition. Therefore, the activation before the classification is passed through a softmax function, ensuring that the probabilities sum to unity, thereby aligning with the desired regression output format.\nThe competition ended quicker than I hoped but I have learned very important skills. 1. Saving model and loading model. Because Kaggle uses its own compute, we get limited 12 hour per session. Once it shutsdown, the notebook resets, deleting everything in output folder. Only way to save a model on Kaggle is to save the notebook itself by running ‚Äòsave version‚Äô option.\nBelow we see an example of saving a notebook and loading it from a different ‚Äòinference notebook‚Äô via path - /kaggle/input/k/leetolo/lmsys-llama-3-tpu-train/llama_3_finetuned_model2.pth. You can also see competition data and base model architecture from Meta. \nWell since the competition ended, let us examine winner‚Äôs solution - notebook by Sayoulala.\n\nFirst of all, winner adds additional 200k dataset discovered by other users who have uploaded publicly.

    "text": "0.3 Weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion (Key component of hybrid search)\nA statistical method combining multiple result sets with different relevance indicators into a single ranked list, with the ability to weight the importance of different retrieval methods.\n\nBest performing individual ranking methods compared to other fusion techniques like Condorcet Fuse and CombMNZ\nWeighted RRF uses a modified formula to determine the score for ranking each document:\n\n\\[ \\text{score} = \\sum_{q \\in \\text{queries}} w_q \\cdot \\frac{1}{k + \\text{rank}(\\text{result}(q), d)} \\]\nWhere: - k is a ranking constant - q is a query in the set of queries - w_q is the weight assigned to query/method q - d is a document in the result set of q - result(q) is the result set of q - rank(result(q), d) is d‚Äôs rank within the result(q) starting from 1\n\nWeighted RRF allows fine-tuning of the contribution of each search method while maintaining the simplicity of the original RRF.\nIt is particularly useful for combining results from different search techniques, such as lexical search and dense vector search, when one method is known to be more reliable for certain types of queries.\n\n\nShow param details\n\n\nk (Ranking Constant): typically set to a small value, such as 60. This constant helps prevent division by zero and adjusts the impact of high-ranked documents.\nrank_window_size: determines the number of top documents from each retriever to consider for fusion.\nweights: dictionary mapping each retrieval method to its weight (e.g., {‚Äòvector‚Äô: 0.7, ‚Äòlexical‚Äô: 0.3})\n\n\n\n\nShow how it works\n\nLet‚Äôs say we have two search methods:\n\nLexical Search (weight = 0.3)\nSemantic Search (weight = 0.7)\n\nOur search: ‚Äúfriendly dragons‚Äù\nStep 1: Get rankings from each method\nLexical Search results:\n\n‚ÄúDragon Friends‚Äù\n‚ÄúBig Book of Creatures‚Äù\n‚ÄúFriendly Pets‚Äù\n\nSemantic Search results:\n\n‚ÄúFriendly Pets‚Äù\n‚ÄúDragon Friends‚Äù\n‚ÄúBig Book of Creatures‚Äù\n\nStep 2: Calculate Weighted RRF scores (using k = 1 for simplicity)\n\n‚ÄúDragon Friends‚Äù: Score = 0.3 * 1/(1 + 1) + 0.7 * 1/(1 + 2) = 0.15 + 0.233 = 0.383\n‚ÄúFriendly Pets‚Äù: Score = 0.3 * 1/(1 + 3) + 0.7 * 1/(1 + 1) = 0.075 + 0.35 = 0.425\n‚ÄúBig Book of Creatures‚Äù: Score = 0.3 * 1/(1 + 2) + 0.7 * 1/(1 + 3) = 0.1 + 0.175 = 0.275\n\nStep 3: Final ranking based on Weighted RRF scores\n\n‚ÄúFriendly Pets‚Äù (0.425)\n‚ÄúDragon Friends‚Äù (0.383)\n‚ÄúBig Book of Creatures‚Äù (0.275)\n\nNote how the higher weight on semantic search (0.7) caused ‚ÄúFriendly Pets‚Äù to rank first in the final results, whereas it would have ranked second with unweighted RRF."

We have no idea what the features represent so it might be meaningless and dangerous 2. The dataset is really big so adding couple more columns will make me run out of memory 3. Much slower computation\n\n\n\nWe are going to use approximately 20000 data as test set. Our target value is action which we already have defined as any weight times resp above 0.(positive trades)\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor technique, we already applied a lot of our knowledge from our EDA into our dataset. (Feature engineering, imputing nulls, dropping &lt; 85 days, etc). For algorithm, we are going to use machine learning.  Now we have our data ready for training. There are hundreds of classifier model we can choose from and explore. However, after studying the Kaggle notebooks other participants have submitted, all high scored model seem to use Neural Network. I am going to try using random forest classifier and MLP to experiment here. Random Forest are always good for early because it is easy to just build and evaluate. Neural network is good at learning complicated models with the right parameter tuning.  #### Metrics Since this is a multiclass-classifying problem (5 types of ‚Äòresp‚Äô -&gt; gave us 5 pos vs neg target variables), for performance metrics we are going to use AUC(area under curve) as well as pure accuracy score for overall performance. With this metrics, we can see how our model is performing on unseen data and prevent overfitting easily to see any area for improvement accordingly. Sklearn and Seaborn provides great graphing tools for these metrics as well. #### Complications Note that the worst complication I had to face going through rest of this notebook was the size of the data. Depending on your computer‚Äôs RAM size and GPU computation speed this experience will vary. In my case, I ran into out of memory a hundreds of times. To avoid this, try using cloud training. If not make sure to save your computed data frequently and clean RAM with gc.collect and del function to free up space as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntest accuracy: 0.5242761692650334\n\n\n\n\nresp\n[[3474 4349]\n [3205 4687]]\nresp_1\n[[4261 3487]\n [3768 4199]]\nresp_2\n[[3740 4001]\n [3367 4607]]\nresp_3\n[[2823 4959]\n [2643 5290]]\nresp_4\n[[3003 4858]\n [2743 5111]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we got about 52.4% accuracy with random forest.  From the confusion matrix, we can tell that the model is having harder time predicting 0‚Äôs correctly. It is actually doing a good job of classifying 1‚Äôs though! So with this model, we can expect to get lots of good trades but also fail to not go for bad trades.\n\n\nThis was our first pass solution. Although we were able to get a positive score of 52.4%, when submitted to Jane Street for Evaluation, it returned a score of 0. Meaning we have lost more profit than we gained. (The competition didn‚Äôt return negative scores and only calculated positive gains). This suggests that although we were able to get more ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô trades, the scale of the trades we failed to predict correctly have out-weighted our correct predictions.\n\n\n\n\nClassic multiple layer perceptron with AUC(Area Under Curve) metrics. After looking at many notebooks on Kaggle, MLP seem to perform the best with short run time. Let us build one ourselves.\n\n\ntest accuracy: 0.5501368119630926\n\n\n\n\nResp: ROC AUC=0.544\nResp_1: ROC AUC=0.559\nResp_2: ROC AUC=0.551\nResp_3: ROC AUC=0.549\nResp_4: ROC AUC=0.547\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 2160x1440 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is actually good! Although one could say that the machine is doing slightly better than me if I was to go to Jane Street and randomly decide to ‚Äòaction‚Äô on trades. \nIt is important to note that even though we are getting only around ~55% accuracy only, this is actually considered good for trading markets. To explain this, since Jane Market has billions of money, as long as they have a positive return rate, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much they lose because in the end they will gain more. It is like going to a casino knowing you have more chance of winning than losing. The more time you spend here, the more you will gain out of it!\n\n\n\nRandomSearch and GridSearch easily runs out of memory..\nSo from trial and error, I‚Äôve learned that with learning rate at 1e-3, model overfits quickly around at 10 with batch_size around 5000. However, the model wasn‚Äôt able to learn much with less than 100 epochs. One solution is to add more layers and perceptrons which is what I did and the result 2 is the result of manual hyper param tuning. Before the model was definetly at around 200 epochs with same learning rate with 5000 batches giving me an accuracy of only 51%. After manual hyperparameter, (running few different param combination by myself) I was able to increase about 3.5% accuracy!\n\n\n\nFor my final review and conclusion, check out my blog post\nOther things to try/explore: 1. Weighted training. We know that sometimes we will encounter ‚Äòmonster‚Äô deals. It is crucial for the Kaggle competition to get these ones correct since these will probably outweight most other trades. So we could make model that focuses more on these heavy trades. (high weight X resp data) 2. Split data and train multiple models. Idea is that we could split the data into two by feature_0 and maybe one model that optimizes the ‚Äò1‚Äôs data and another model that optimizes the‚Äô-1‚Äôs data. 3. Make much more features and explore more data (requires time and big data machines) 4. One interesting thing I learned is that apparently, in financial, it is sometimes good to heavily overfit the model. Something to do with volatile. I‚Äôve experimented with this and indeed my utility score for the competition went really high when super overfitted with epoches over 200.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImputing-missing-values  OWN Jane Street with Keras NN"

    "text": "test accuracy: 0.5242761692650334\n\n\n\n\nresp\n[[3474 4349]\n [3205 4687]]\nresp_1\n[[4261 3487]\n [3768 4199]]\nresp_2\n[[3740 4001]\n [3367 4607]]\nresp_3\n[[2823 4959]\n [2643 5290]]\nresp_4\n[[3003 4858]\n [2743 5111]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we got about 52.4% accuracy with random forest.  From the confusion matrix, we can tell that the model is having harder time predicting 0‚Äôs correctly. It is actually doing a good job of classifying 1‚Äôs though! So with this model, we can expect to get lots of good trades but also fail to not go for bad trades.\n\n\nThis was our first pass solution. Although we were able to get a positive score of 52.4%, when submitted to Jane Street for Evaluation, it returned a score of 0. Meaning we have lost more profit than we gained. (The competition didn‚Äôt return negative scores and only calculated positive gains). This suggests that although we were able to get more ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô trades, the scale of the trades we failed to predict correctly have out-weighted our correct predictions.\n\n\n\n\nClassic multiple layer perceptron with AUC(Area Under Curve) metrics. After looking at many notebooks on Kaggle, MLP seem to perform the best with short run time. Let us build one ourselves.\n\n\ntest accuracy: 0.5501368119630926\n\n\n\n\nResp: ROC AUC=0.544\nResp_1: ROC AUC=0.559\nResp_2: ROC AUC=0.551\nResp_3: ROC AUC=0.549\nResp_4: ROC AUC=0.547\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 2160x1440 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is actually good! Although one could say that the machine is doing slightly better than me if I was to go to Jane Street and randomly decide to ‚Äòaction‚Äô on trades. \nIt is important to note that even though we are getting only around ~55% accuracy only, this is actually considered good for trading markets. To explain this, since Jane Market has billions of money, as long as they have a positive return rate, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much they lose because in the end they will gain more. It is like going to a casino knowing you have more chance of winning than losing. The more time you spend here, the more you will gain out of it!\n\n\n\nRandomSearch and GridSearch easily runs out of memory..\nSo from trial and error, I‚Äôve learned that with learning rate at 1e-3, model overfits quickly around at 10 with batch_size around 5000. However, the model wasn‚Äôt able to learn much with less than 100 epochs. One solution is to add more layers and perceptrons which is what I did and the result 2 is the result of manual hyper param tuning. Before the model was definetly at around 200 epochs with same learning rate with 5000 batches giving me an accuracy of only 51%. After manual hyperparameter, (running few different param combination by myself) I was able to increase about 3.5% accuracy!\n\n\n\nFor my final review and conclusion, check out my blog post\nOther things to try/explore: 1. Weighted training. We know that sometimes we will encounter ‚Äòmonster‚Äô deals. It is crucial for the Kaggle competition to get these ones correct since these will probably outweight most other trades. So we could make model that focuses more on these heavy trades. (high weight X resp data) 2. Split data and train multiple models. Idea is that we could split the data into two by feature_0 and maybe one model that optimizes the ‚Äò1‚Äôs data and another model that optimizes the‚Äô-1‚Äôs data. 3. Make much more features and explore more data (requires time and big data machines) 4. One interesting thing I learned is that apparently, in financial, it is sometimes good to heavily overfit the model. Something to do with volatile. I‚Äôve experimented with this and indeed my utility score for the competition went really high when super overfitted with epoches over 200.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImputing-missing-values  OWN Jane Street with Keras NN"

So positive coefs. here means helpful for the Blue team and negative coefs. means helpful for the Red team. Most of the fields in the top 20 table above, are not something we see often. For example 435-aphelios(top), 689-sion(adc), 248-sona(top) are considered troll. Here are some other findings. - Looks like every lane is somewhat equally important as their appearance in the table above are similiar - Most of these are troll picks negatively affecting its own team‚Äôs winrate - Picks that are actually helping team‚Äôs winrate: Sion(ADC), Pantheon(ADC), Yasuo(Sup)??, Ekko(Sup)?? - This table raises more questions than answers!\n\n\nRandom Forests\n\n\nRandomForestClassifier(max_leaf_nodes=32, n_estimators=2000, n_jobs=-1)\n\n\n\n\ntest accuracy: 0.8003442340791739\n\n\nWow we went from 0% to 80% accuracy with random forest!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, West Europe tend to win more as Blue team as games are longer. In contrast, Korea tend to win more as Red Team as games gets longer. So there seem to be a trend difference between regions. Furthermore, in general, the shorter the game, blue team wins more for some reason I cannot figure out.\n\n\nBest/Worst Composition\nBest - (Top)Camille,Yone (Jg)Hecarim,Olaf,Twitch (Mid)Akali (Adc)Miss Fortune,Jhin (Sup)Alistar,Janna,Leona \nWorst - (Top)Pantheon,Irelia (Jg)Wukong (Mid)Sylas,Yone\nIf we compare this with the official na.op.gg champion rankings, all the best champions listed here are also listed on their website as either tier one or two as well. (Except Twitch and Pantheon).  Note that this is just for comparison. Op.gg has million times more data with more regions. Also how they rank these champions are not revealed.\n\n\nComparing with S10\n\nBest team composition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst team composition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons - The new update caused each roles to impact more evenly to the game‚Äôs result - Bottom lane has generally good picks with no worst picks in season 11. - The new update caused more ‚Äòhigh risk high reward‚Äô champions to win more and ‚Äògenerally good‚Äô champions to fall"

    "text": "Jane Street Market Prediction Kaggle Competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project is based on Kaggle competition by Jane Street - Jane Street Market Prediction  ‚ÄúBuy low, sell high‚Äù sounds easy. In reality, we know trading is difficult to solve and even more so in today‚Äôs fast financial markets. Developing strategy with machine learning model can help us maximize returns using market data from a major global stock exchange. Then the competition will take our predictiveness to model against future market returns and give feedback on the leaderboard. My goal is to explore financial area of data science and explore Kaggle community as much as possible. \nIn general, if one is able to generate a highly predictive model which selects the right trades to execute, they would also be playing an important role in sending the market signals that push prices closer to ‚Äúfair‚Äù values. That is, a better model will mean the market will be more efficient going forward. However, developing good models will be challenging for many reasons, including a very low signal-to-noise ratio, potential redundancy, strong feature correlation, and difficulty of coming up with a proper mathematical formulation.  (src: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/overview/description)\n\n\n\nanonymized set of features, feature_{0‚Ä¶129}, representing real stock market data. \neach row in the dataset represents a trading opportunity, for which you will be predicting an action value: 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. \neach trade has an associated weight and resp, which together represents a return on the trade. \ndate column is an integer which represents the day of the trade, while ts_id represents a time ordering. \nin addition to anonymized feature values, you are provided with metadata about the features in features.csv. \nmore info: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/data\n\n\n\n\nWhere 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. The goal is minimize choosing bad trades and maximizing good trades.  #### Proposing a solution Even the world‚Äôs finest financial expert wouldn‚Äôt be able to gain anything from this anonymized data. Hence we are forced to use machine learning or data science approach to solve this problem.  Since the goal is clear (maximize profit) we want to see which features seem important or strange through EDA and visualizations. We will also have to grasp understanding of the data so it is not just a big 6GB of numbers. This will help us decide what to do with missing values and do feature engineering to help the computer learn.  Then we are going to build classifier model to let the computer do the hard work of learning to make good predictions. Of course, these models will be terrible at first so we will have to supervise it closely with some hyperparameters and strict evaluations.  Finally, the Jane Street will evaluate our submission and tell us if it is any good : ) #### Metrics The competition is evaluated on a utility score. Each row in the test set represents a trading opportunity for which you will be predicting an action value. Each trade j has an associated weight and resp, which represents a return. Weight and resp are not defined on test data set.\nFor each date i, we define:\n\\(pi=‚àë_{j}(weight_{ij}‚àóresp_{ij}‚àóaction{i_j})\\)\n\\(t=\\dfrac{‚àëp_i}{‚àëp_{i}^2}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{250}{|i|}}\\)\nwhere |i| is the number of unique dates in the test set. The utility is then defined as: \\(u=min(max(t,0),6)‚àëpi.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.shape: (2390491, 138)\nhow many days? 500days\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nweight\nresp_1\nresp_2\nresp_3\nresp_4\nresp\nfeature_0\nfeature_1\nfeature_2\n...\nfeature_121\nfeature_122\nfeature_123\nfeature_124\nfeature_125\nfeature_126\nfeature_127\nfeature_128\nfeature_129\nts_id\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0.000000\n0.009916\n0.014079\n0.008773\n0.001390\n0.006270\n1\n-1.872746\n-2.191242\n...\nNaN\n1.168391\n8.313583\n1.782433\n14.018213\n2.653056\n12.600292\n2.301488\n11.445807\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n16.673515\n-0.002828\n-0.003226\n-0.007319\n-0.011114\n-0.009792\n-1\n-1.349537\n-1.704709\n...\nNaN\n-1.178850\n1.777472\n-0.915458\n2.831612\n-1.417010\n2.297459\n-1.304614\n1.898684\n1\n\n\n2\n0\n0.000000\n0.025134\n0.027607\n0.033406\n0.034380\n0.023970\n-1\n0.812780\n-0.256156\n...\nNaN\n6.115747\n9.667908\n5.542871\n11.671595\n7.281757\n10.060014\n6.638248\n9.427299\n2\n\n\n3\n0\n0.000000\n-0.004730\n-0.003273\n-0.000461\n-0.000476\n-0.003200\n-1\n1.174378\n0.344640\n...\nNaN\n2.838853\n0.499251\n3.033732\n1.513488\n4.397532\n1.266037\n3.856384\n1.013469\n3\n\n\n4\n0\n0.138531\n0.001252\n0.002165\n-0.001215\n-0.006219\n-0.002604\n1\n-3.172026\n-3.093182\n...\nNaN\n0.344850\n4.101145\n0.614252\n6.623456\n0.800129\n5.233243\n0.362636\n3.926633\n4\n\n\n\n\n5 rows √ó 138 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nweight\nresp_1\nresp_2\nresp_3\nresp_4\nresp\nfeature_0\nfeature_1\nfeature_2\n...\nfeature_121\nfeature_122\nfeature_123\nfeature_124\nfeature_125\nfeature_126\nfeature_127\nfeature_128\nfeature_129\nts_id\n\n\n\n\ncount\n2.390491e+06\n2.390491e+06\n2.390491e+06\n2.390491e+06\n2.390491e+06\n2.390491e+06\n2.390491e+06\n2.390491e+06\n2.390491e+06\n2.390491e+06\n...\n2.320637e+06\n2.390268e+06\n2.390268e+06\n2.374408e+06\n2.374408e+06\n2.381638e+06\n2.381638e+06\n2.388570e+06\n2.388570e+06\n2.390491e+06\n\n\nmean\n2.478668e+02\n3.031535e+00\n1.434969e-04\n1.980749e-04\n2.824183e-04\n4.350201e-04\n4.083113e-04\n9.838565e-03\n3.855776e-01\n3.576875e-01\n...\n2.687757e-01\n3.435523e-01\n2.799973e-01\n3.351537e-01\n2.448752e-01\n3.391778e-01\n2.323809e-01\n3.425608e-01\n2.456182e-01\n1.195245e+06\n\n\nstd\n1.522746e+02\n7.672794e+00\n8.930163e-03\n1.230236e-02\n1.906882e-02\n3.291224e-02\n2.693609e-02\n9.999518e-01\n2.559373e+00\n2.477335e+00\n...\n2.174238e+00\n2.087842e+00\n1.977643e+00\n1.742587e+00\n2.242853e+00\n2.534498e+00\n1.795854e+00\n2.307130e+00\n1.765419e+00\n6.900755e+05\n\n\nmin\n0.000000e+00\n0.000000e+00\n-3.675043e-01\n-5.328334e-01\n-5.681196e-01\n-5.987447e-01\n-5.493845e-01\n-1.000000e+00\n-3.172026e+00\n-3.093182e+00\n...\n-7.471971e+00\n-5.862979e+00\n-6.029281e+00\n-4.080720e+00\n-8.136407e+00\n-8.215050e+00\n-5.765982e+00\n-7.024909e+00\n-5.282181e+00\n0.000000e+00\n\n\n25%\n1.040000e+02\n1.617400e-01\n-1.859162e-03\n-2.655044e-03\n-5.030704e-03\n-9.310415e-03\n-7.157903e-03\n-1.000000e+00\n-1.299334e+00\n-1.263628e+00\n...\n-1.123252e+00\n-1.114326e+00\n-9.512009e-01\n-9.133750e-01\n-1.212124e+00\n-1.452912e+00\n-8.993050e-01\n-1.278341e+00\n-8.544535e-01\n5.976225e+05\n\n\n50%\n2.540000e+02\n7.086770e-01\n4.552665e-05\n6.928179e-05\n1.164734e-04\n1.222579e-04\n8.634997e-05\n1.000000e+00\n-1.870182e-05\n-7.200577e-07\n...\n0.000000e+00\n7.006244e-17\n6.054629e-17\n4.870826e-17\n-2.558675e-16\n1.015055e-16\n5.419920e-17\n8.563069e-17\n4.869529e-17\n1.195245e+06\n\n\n75%\n3.820000e+02\n2.471791e+00\n2.097469e-03\n2.939111e-03\n5.466336e-03\n9.804649e-03\n7.544347e-03\n1.000000e+00\n1.578417e+00\n1.526399e+00\n...\n1.342829e+00\n1.405926e+00\n1.308625e+00\n1.228277e+00\n1.409687e+00\n1.767275e+00\n1.111491e+00\n1.582633e+00\n1.125321e+00\n1.792868e+06\n\n\nmax\n4.990000e+02\n1.672937e+02\n2.453477e-01\n2.949339e-01\n3.265597e-01\n5.113795e-01\n4.484616e-01\n1.000000e+00\n7.442989e+01\n1.480763e+02\n...\n1.107771e+02\n4.812516e+01\n1.276908e+02\n6.514517e+01\n7.052807e+01\n5.872849e+01\n6.932221e+01\n5.119038e+01\n1.164568e+02\n2.390490e+06\n\n\n\n\n8 rows √ó 138 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfeature\ntag_0\ntag_1\ntag_2\ntag_3\ntag_4\ntag_5\ntag_6\ntag_7\ntag_8\n...\ntag_19\ntag_20\ntag_21\ntag_22\ntag_23\ntag_24\ntag_25\ntag_26\ntag_27\ntag_28\n\n\n\n\ncount\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n...\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n130\n\n\nunique\n130\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n...\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n\ntop\nfeature_25\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n...\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\nfreq\n1\n113\n113\n113\n113\n113\n122\n90\n128\n128\n...\n123\n125\n125\n121\n82\n118\n118\n118\n118\n118\n\n\n\n\n4 rows √ó 30 columns\n\n\n\nAs told, all the featues and even tags are anonymized.

For the full enlarged version of the histograms, check out here It would be safe to fill the null values with medians. Other imputation method considered were mean and KNN-Imputation. Check out my other notebook where KNN-Imputation was used to train MLP.\n::: {#cell-17 .cell _kg_hide-input=‚Äòtrue‚Äô execution_count=21}\n\nfeature with most nans: feature_27, with 395535\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\nIf we just remove all nans, we would be removing more than 16.54% of the dataset.\nInteresting points so far: - feature_0 is binary. - A lot of features seems to be normally distributed. - A lot of missing values.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-23 .cell _kg_hide-input=‚Äòtrue‚Äô execution_count=25}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\nWe can see that resp is closely related to resp_4 (blue and purple). Resp_1 and resp_2 also seem to be closely related but much much linear. Resp_3 seem to be in the middle, where the shape is closer to upper group but position is slightly closer to green and orange.\n\n\n\nNote: weight and resp multiplied together represents a return on the trade.\n::: {#cell-27 .cell _kg_hide-input=‚Äòtrue‚Äô execution_count=11}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\nWe can see that most weights are around 0.2 and we can see two ‚Äòpeaks‚Äô which is around 0.2 and 0.3. Note that maximum weight was 167.29 represented by 1.0 on x-axis. Thus 0.2 represents around 33.458 and 0.3 represents around 50.187.\n::: {#cell-29 .cell _kg_hide-input=‚Äòtrue‚Äô execution_count=9}\n\n2921\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\nNote that the graph plots all the positive gains. (Our 1‚Äôs for our action column). So we can see that there were ‚Äòbigger‚Äô gains in the beginning and as time approach 500, the gain becomes smaller. In conclusion, the earlier trades are much bigger but we don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs going to be like in our competition test set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that we probability want to invest more ‚Äòweight‚Äô if there are bigger ‚Äòresp‚Äô(return). We learn here that higher weights are only when resp is close to 0. In other words, it is dumb to trade if resp is away from 0 but it is safe to invest even a lot if it is near 0.\n::: {#cell-33 .cell _kg_hide-input=‚Äòtrue‚Äô execution_count=13}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n74963\n\n:::\nIn the Kaggle community, there‚Äôs been lots of discussion on how the trends changed significantly since day ~85. We can see much more trades happening before day 100. Rest of the days are still very active but not as noisy. We can suggest that there has been a change of trading model from Jane Street as discussed here by Carl.\nLet us look at the most important feature, ‚Äòfeature_0‚Äô\n\n\n 1    1207005\n-1    1183486\nName: feature_0, dtype: int64\n\n\n::: {#cell-37 .cell _kg_hide-input=‚Äòtrue‚Äô execution_count=15}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\nInterestingly, when feature_0 is 1, plot shows negative slope while in contrast, when feature_0 is -1, plot shows positive slope. My guess is that feature_0 corresponds to Buy(1) and Sell(-1) or vice versa. So if we set action to 1 with feature_0 = 1 then we are selling and when we set action to 0 with feature_0 = -1, then we are buying. This makes sense since whether we are buying or selling we can still lose or gain profit.\n\n\n\nRemember that we have another file called features.csv. Which can help us understand 100+ features and maybe cluster into groups. Let‚Äôs take a look. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us see what tag_0 groups tells us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation between features of tag_0. It looks like there certainly are correlation between elements of the group except a few.\nInteresting points: - feature_0 has no tags - feature 79 to 119 all has 4 tags - feature 7 to 36 have 3 and 4 tags periodically - Similar trend between 2 to 7, 37 to 40, 120 to 129 - tag_n doesn‚Äôt tell too much about the features\n\n\n\n\n\nJane Street: EDA of day 0 and feature importance\nJane_street_Extensive_EDA & PCA starter üìä‚ö°\nEDA / A Quant‚Äôs Prespective\n\n\n\n\nIn another notebook. ### Implementation Planning Thoughts going into predicting phase. 1. Days before ~100 can be dropped as suspicion of model shift. 2. Feature_0 seem very important to find slope of cummulative resp. 3. Resp near 0 is prefered over other values. 4. A lot of features are normally distributed. 5. We have over 2 million datas, it would be safe to add lot more features(feature enginerring) 6. There are a lot of missing values too. Can try mean, median or KNN imputation methods. 7. Note that although this is kind of a time series data, we can only predict with features 0 to 129"

This makes sense since whether we are buying or selling we can still lose or gain profit.\n\n\n\nRemember that we have another file called features.csv.

Days before ~100 can be dropped as suspicion of model shift. 2. Feature_0 seem very important to find slope of cummulative resp. 3. Resp near 0 is prefered over other values. 4. A lot of features are normally distributed. 5. We have over 2 million datas, it would be safe to add lot more features(feature enginerring) 6. There are a lot of missing values too. Can try mean, median or KNN imputation methods. 7. Note that although this is kind of a time series data, we can only predict with features 0 to 129"

    "text": "Book Reviews\nThe simplicity and the colorful cover made me decide to buy this book. I am glad that I purchased this book because as a statistic student this book showed me the real world statistics that textbooks cannot show with their equations and proofs. My favorite story was about a killer disguised as a doctor who killed tens of innocent seniors and his suspicions were confirmed with statistical methods. Every chapter starts with a really interesting question, for example, ‚ÄúWho was the luckiest person on Titanic?‚Äù and answers with a statistical approach. It was delightful seeing concepts like p-value, hypothesis testing, regression and inference playing in real life problems, sometimes comically failing.\nI would definitely recommend this book to anyone wondering ‚ÄúI know statistics are useful but where do we see these being used?‚Äù.  Personal rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nThis was my first ever machine learning book that I bought because I suddenly got really interested in data science. I remember reading this book everyday and getting excited when I copied-pasted the algorithms shown in the book and they worked. The book was definetly beginner friendly in the beginning but it becomes really challenging in the later chapters. For example reading about attention mechanism in recurrent neural networks. (I am still confused to this day). The book really shines because it explains everything with pictures and diagrams. Also note they have a Git repository for the book so you can quickly use any machine learning you learn in real life.\nI would definetly recommen this book to anyone wanting to learn about machine learning. I wouldn‚Äôt rely just on the book though, it will be really helpful to take course or other similiar books as well because I find that learning about machine learning is best when you just keep reading and practicing more.  Personal rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nO‚ÄôReilly always produce pretty cover that it is hard to resist not buying their book. I got interested in generative deep learning because it is one of the big machine learning pieces(generative learning, unsupervised learning, supervised learning, reinforcement learning). When I was reading this book, I really felt the author really cares about this book and that they took a lot of effort writing this book. I loved its way of explaining deep learning concepts through simple pictures and stories. For example, it compares encoders and decoders as a painter trying to fool a museum owner making him think that the painting is real when it is really fake.\nOverall, this book does not answer every question you have since generative deep learning is fairly unexplored area but if you want to quickly learn enough to get yourself started inplementing genrative deep learning models, this is a great book.  Personal rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nKaggle is a great data science online community created by Google. They often hold highly competitive global data science competitions where a small data scientist like myself gain huge amount of experience, often by consuming tiny crumbles of informations and practices from experts. This book was written by one of the biggest giant in the community who have won multiple competitions. What the book does the best is guiding readers creating their own data science projects. If you ever get stuck in one area, the book gives you clear directions. If you are a programmer interested in writing machine learning applications, this is a great guide.  Personal rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nIn this 1963 American tv show, the host Monty Hall proposes a game to the contestant. There are three closed doors. Two of the doors have goats behind them and one of the doors has a fancy car behind it. The contestants get to keep whatever is behind the door they choose. Once the contestant chooses one of the doors, Monty opens one of the unchosen doors showing a goat behind it. Then Monty asks the contestant if he/she wants to change their decision on the remaining two doors. Should the contestant change?\nMost people will think the contestant has 1/2 chance of winning. I too thought this way but by switching, the contestant actually doubles their chance of winning. To see this most clearly, consider a similar test with 100 doors instead of 3. Now, once you choose a door, Monty opens 98 other doors showing goats and asks you if you want to switch. Obviously, you should switch to the other door because the original choice had 1/100 chance of winning but the other door is same as having had 99 choices to choose the correct door with 99% chance of winning. So in our original case, the door we chose initially has 1/3 chance of winning but choosing the other door has 2/3 chance. Hence doubling our chance of winning. If you are still not convinced, you can try out yourself here http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/SimpleMontyHall/."

    "text": "DataFest 2021 @ University of Toronto\n\nFull project - link\n\n\nThe growing non-medical use of prescription drugs is a global health concern. The Canadian‚Äôs Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs Survey data collected by RADARS¬Æ System gives an opportunity to understand the situation. Our team explored the raw survey data by visualizing, and came up with three research questions for the report.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/leejaeka/Datafest2021/blob/main/data/CA-Data/Data%20Dictionary%20CA%2017Q3.doc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe assumed all surveys were answered truthfully and recorded without errors\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 185 variables in total to consider. How do we explore all of these?\nAbout 20% of the cells in the dataset are NANs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used principal components and mutual information to compute which variables to keep.\nWe fill the missing value with best logical answers. For example, variables on pregnancy for all males were ‚ÄòNA‚Äô. We fill the missing value with 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used principal components and mutual information to compute which variables to keep. #### Steps 1.

Introduction\nChunking is a complicated step in RAG.\nPopular chunking strategies (2024)\n\nFixed-size chunking - This is the most common and straightforward approach to chunking. ‚ÄúContain as much information in each chunk‚Äù\nRecursive chunking with overlap - This strategy divides the input text into smaller chunks in a hierarchical and iterative manner using a set of separators. It aims to keep semantically related pieces of text together while maintaining a target chunk size.\nContext-aware chunking - This technique splits documents based on semantic markers such as punctuation, paragraph breaks, or HTML/Markdown tags. Effective for documents with well-defined structures.\n\nThere is no one chunking strategy that works for every situation. In this notebook, I‚Äôm going compare Fixed-size chunking and Contextual chunking by Anthropic."

Use llm with bigger context window size 2. Chunk smaller 3. return less top k"

This demonstrates how effective hyperparameter optimization can be, even without complex feature engineering or model ensemble.\nWhile studying TPE optimizers, I discovered that hyperparameter optimization has evolved significantly beyond this classical approach. Recent advances have introduced more sophisticated algorithms:\n\nMultivariate TPE improves upon traditional TPE by capturing dependencies between hyperparameters, leading to more efficient optimization1.\nCMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) has shown superior optimization quality compared to TPE in recent studies"
