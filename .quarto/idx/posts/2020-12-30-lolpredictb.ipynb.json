This year, they changed their item system, drastically changing their game ecosystem. It has been few months since the big update and now players have fully adapted to the changes. Let's take a look at what happened to the ecosystem and what is the best team composition now.\n\n- Find out what are the most popular champions now.\n- Find out which team composition is the best.\n- Compare Season 10 and pre-Season 11. How did the item changes impact the game?\n\n### The dataset\nThe data we are going to use is a csv file obtained from scraping op.gg which is a website with League of Legend statistics. If you are interested you can visit [here](https://github.com/leejaeka/MyDatas/tree/main/lolgames). The dataset consists of 2901 ranked matches from Korea(WWW), North America(NA), Eastern Europe(EUNE), and Western Europe(EUW) servers. It has which team won the match, the total time of the match, blue team composition and red team composition. Note that only the high elo games were added this includes Challenger, Grand Master, Master and sometimes even High Diamonds. Note that there are 153 total unique champions with 'Rell' as the latest addition. Duplicate games have been removed.\n\n### Data Cleaning\n1. Change game_length to continuous variable\n2. Clean null values and uninformative columns\n3. Change categorical variables to dummy variables\n\n\n### Most popular champions \n- Camille(Top): 19.68% pick rate\n- Graves(Jg): 37.4% pick rate\n- Akali/Yone(Mid): 15.89% pick rate combined\n- Jhin/Kai'sa(Adc): 39.92% pick rate combined\n- Leona(Supp): 25.37% pick rate <br>\n\nNotes:\n- The result is very skewed because there are 2271 Red Team win compared to only 630 Blue Team wins\n- There are in total 2901 games and more than half of it is from Korean server\n\nSo there are no null values which is good!\n\nThe data is ready for modelling.\n\n### Linear Regression\n\nClearly, linear regression is a poor model for this problem haha. Makes sense since we only have discrete fields except game_length.\n\nRecall that 1 = Blue win and 0 = Red win. So positive coefs. here means helpful for the Blue team and negative coefs. means helpful for the Red team. Most of the fields in the top 20 table above, are not something we see often. For example 435-aphelios(top), 689-sion(adc), 248-sona(top) are considered troll. Here are some other findings.\n- Looks like every lane is somewhat equally important as their appearance in the table above are similiar\n- Most of these are troll picks negatively affecting its own team's winrate\n- Picks that are actually helping team's winrate: Sion(ADC), Pantheon(ADC), Yasuo(Sup)??, Ekko(Sup)??\n- This table raises more questions than answers!\n\n### Random Forests\n\nWow we went from 0% to 80% accuracy with random forest!\n\nInterestingly, West Europe tend to win more as Blue team as games are longer. In contrast, Korea tend to win more as Red Team as games gets longer. So there seem to be a trend difference between regions. Furthermore, in general, the shorter the game, blue team wins more for some reason I cannot figure out. \n\n### Best/Worst Composition\nBest\n- (Top)Camille,Yone (Jg)Hecarim,Olaf,Twitch (Mid)Akali (Adc)Miss Fortune,Jhin (Sup)Alistar,Janna,Leona <br>\n\nWorst\n- (Top)Pantheon,Irelia (Jg)Wukong (Mid)Sylas,Yone \n\nIf we compare this with the official na.op.gg champion rankings, all the best champions listed here are also listed on their website as either tier one or two as well.
