These datas were collected from op.gg by web scrapping with python spyder. The latest game was played on Oct.16th on the dataset. In total there are 4028 unique games. Note that I've used one-hot encoding hence [99,54,101,73,57,96,52,102,68,52] this list represents number of all unique champions used in each lanes [BlueTop, BlueJG, BlueMid, BlueAdc, BlueSup, RedTop, RedJg, RedMid, RedAdc, RedSup] respectivley. Note that there are in total 151 unique champions with 'Samira' as the latest addition.\n\nSome Setups\n\n## Datas are one hot encoded and cleaned up. Let's train test split\n\n## Let's try Neural Network with dropouts\n\nWe got about 0.661 accuracy with just raw neural network with dropouts.\n\n## Let's try random forests\n\nImmediate improvement by almost 10% with random forest classifier!\n\n## Model Explanability\n\nLet's look at what we were mostly interested. What are some best team compositions!\n\n## Let's try SHAP summary\n\n- We see that feature 0 (game length) tells us that the game favors blue team winning more when game is shorter which is unexpected. Note that it it not significant at all since SHAP value is -0.02 ~ 0.4 at most.\n- Generally, since all the values are 0 are 1, we can see clear 1-red and 0-blue (When it's 0 it has no impact on the prediction)\n- We can see feature 156(blue Mid Akali) helped RED team win more\n- Whereas Feature 462(red Top Tryndamere) helps the BLUE team win significantly more haha\n- From this chart, we can clearly see that each champion has very consistent and predictable contribution to their team's chance of winning \n\nNote that\n- 119 Kindred blue jg\n- 638 Caitlyn red adc\n- 60 Renekton blue top\n- 162 Cassiopeia blue mid\n- 535 Akali red mid\n- 376 Thresh blue support\n- 471 Volibear red top\n- 31 Jax blue top\n- 654 Kalista red adc\n- 290 Miss Fortune blue adc\n- 259 Ashe blue adc\n- 360 Rakan blue support\n- 210 Orianna blue mid\n- 462 Tryndamere red top\n- 445 Riven red top\n- 425 Lucian red top\n- 715 Janna red support\n- 156 Akali blue mid\n- 72 Sylas blue top\n\nTherefore our best teamp comp impacting positively on winning is ...\n- (Top)Renekton/Jax/Sylas (Jg)Kindred (Mid) Cassiopeia/Orianna (Adc)MF/Ashe (Sup)Thresh/Rakan\n\nMeanwhile worst team comp impacting negatively on winning is ...\n- (Top)Volibear/Trynd/Riven/Lucian (Mid)Akali (Adc)Caitlyn/Kalista (Sup)Janna\n\nWe can also note that Jg role seem to not matter much.. : )\n\n## What if we didn't have game length, just champion compositions only?\n\nSurprisingly, accuracy only drops less than 0.01. We can conclude that planning out a team comp based on champion's strength on early vs late game does not help win more. This can be explained by an example. Let's say I picked kayle which is the best late game champion. We may win games with longer duration more but will lose more short games due to her weakness early. So the overall win rate balances out.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- best: (Top)Renekton/Jax/Sylas (Jg)Kindred (Mid) Cassiopeia/Orianna (Adc)MF/Ashe (Sup)Thresh/Rakan \n- worst: (Top)Volibear/Trynd/Riven/Lucian (Mid)Akali (Adc)Caitlyn/Kalista (Sup)Janna \n\nWe know that in the world of solo queue, picking the above champions will not gurantee a win. Sometimes people are autofilled, meaning they aren't playing on their best role. People may disconnect, resulting in games favoring the opposite team. There are too many unknown factors like this, making it impossible to predict 100% of the game outcomes correctly. \n\nAs a former high elo NA player myself, I can say that generally, the 'best team' above have champions that doesn't get countered too often and is a good pick into anything. (This may not be the case for top because I've never really cared about top lanes as a support player :). But for 'worst team' champions, they are often easily countered. (Especially bottom lane) \n\nThe biggest surprise was blue team wins more early and red team wins more late (Very slightly but certainly) for some reason. \nAlso jg mattering the least was a surprise as well. \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n> LOL s10 high elo ranked games prediction.\n\n- toc: true \n- badges: true\n- comments: true\n- author: Jaekang Lee\n- image: images/diagram.png\n- categories: [fastpages, jupyter]## Introduction\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nLet's predict who won the match given team composition and how long game played out\n\n## Get dataset\n\nThe dataset is a collection of League of Legends High Elo(Challenger, GM, Master, High Diamonds) Ranked games in Season 10, Korea(WWW), North America(NA), Eastern Europe(EUNE), and Western Europe(EUW) servers.
