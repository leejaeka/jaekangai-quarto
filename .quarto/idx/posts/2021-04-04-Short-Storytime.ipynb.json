Monte Hall Problem </center>\n\nIn this 1963 American tv show, the host Monty Hall proposes a game to the contestant. There are three closed doors. Two of the doors have goats behind them and one of the doors has a fancy car behind it. The contestants get to keep whatever is behind the door they choose. Once the contestant chooses one of the doors, Monty opens one of the unchosen doors showing a goat behind it. Then Monty asks the contestant if he/she wants to change their decision on the remaining two doors. Should the contestant change?\n\nMost people will think the contestant has 1/2 chance of winning. I too thought this way but by switching, the contestant actually doubles their chance of winning. To see this most clearly, consider a similar test with 100 doors instead of 3. Now, once you choose a door, Monty opens 98 other doors showing goats and asks you if you want to switch. Obviously, you should switch to the other door because the original choice had 1/100 chance of winning but the other door is same as having had 99 choices to choose the correct door with 99% chance of winning. So in our original case, the door we chose initially has 1/3 chance of winning but choosing the other door has 2/3 chance. Hence doubling our chance of winning.
